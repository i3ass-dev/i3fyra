# long_description

The layout consists of four containers:  

``` text
  A B
  C D
```

A container can contain one or more windows. The internal layout of the containers doesn't matter. By default the layout of each container is tabbed.  

A is always to the left of B and D. And always above C. B is always to the right of A and C. And always above D.  

This means that the containers will change names if their position changes.  

The size of the containers are defined by the three splits: AB, AC and BD.  

Container A and C belong to one family.  
Container B and D belong to one family.  

The visibility of containers and families can be toggled. Not visible containers are placed on the scratchpad.  

The visibility is toggled by either using *show* (`-s`) or *hide* (`-z`). But more often by moving a container in an *impossible* direction, (*see examples below*).  

The **i3fyra** layout is only active on one workspace. That workspace can be set with the environment variable: `i3FYRA_WS`, otherwise the workspace active when the layout is created will be used.  

The benefit of using this layout is that the placement of windows is more predictable and easier to control. Especially when using tabbed containers, which are very clunky to use with *default i3*.

# examples

If containers **A**,**B** and **C** are visible but **D** is hidden or none existent, the visible layout would looks like this:  

``` text
  A B
  C B
```

If action: *move up* (`-m u`) would be called when container **B** is active and **D** is hidden. Container **D** would be shown. If action would have been: *move down* (`-m d`), **D** would be shown but **B** would be placed below **D**, this means that the containers will also swap names. If action would have been *move left* (`-m l`) the active window in B would be moved to container **A**. If action was *move right* (`-m r`) **A** and **C** would be hidden:  

``` text
  B B
  B B
```

If we now *move left* (`-m l`), **A** and **C** would be shown again but to the right of **B**, the containers would also change names, so **B** becomes **A**, **A** becomes **B** and **C** becomes **D**:  

``` text
  A B
  A D
```
