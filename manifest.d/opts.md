# options-force-description
If set virtual positions will be ignored.

# options-array-description
ARRAY should be the output of `i3list`. It is used to improve speed when **i3fyra** is executed from a script that already have the array, f.i. **i3run** and **i3Kornhe**.  

# options-verbose-description
If set information about execution will be printed to **stderr**.

# options-dryrun-description
If set no window manipulation will be done during execution.

# options-float-description

Autolayout. If current window is tiled: floating enabled If window is floating, it will be put in a visible container. If there is no visible containers. The window will be placed in a hidden container. If no containers exist, container 'A'will be created and the window will be put there.

# options-show-description

If argument is a direction and there is no container in that direction, Connected container(s) visibility is toggled. If current window is floating or not inside ABCD, normal movement is performed. Distance for moving floating windows with this action can be defined with the `--speed` option. Example: `$ i3fyra --speed 30 -m r` Will move current window 30 pixels to the right, if it is floating.

# options-target-description

Criteria is a string passed to i3list to use a different target then active window.

# options-hide-description

# options-layout-description

alter splits Changes the given splits. INT is a distance in pixels. AB is on X axis from the left side if INT is positive, from the right side if it is negative. AC and BD is on Y axis from the top if INT is positive, from the bottom if it is negative. The whole argument needs to be quoted. Example:  
`$ i3fyra --layout 'AB=-300 BD=420'`
